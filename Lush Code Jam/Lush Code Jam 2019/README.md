**LUSH Digital Code Jam 2019** 

The following repo was created to store all the results from the first Lush Digital Code Jam held from the 12-13th June 2019 in association with Bournemouth University (BU). Special Thanks to [George Corney](https://github.com/haxiomic) for being our guest speaker and helping to guide the students on both days of the event along with [myself](https://github.com/ollyc2015) and [James Ash](https://github.com/jaxfire). Also, thanks to [Dr. Gernot Liebchen](https://github.com/gliebchen) and [Dr. Shahin Rostami](https://github.com/shahinrostami) for facilitating the event between Lush Digital and BU.

There were 4 teams working on their own unique solution to an abstract Creative Programming scenario.

As a goal of Creative Programming is to create something expressive instead of something functional, we encouraged students to build something that had a Lush feel to it, which invoked some sort of emotion through sound, visuals etc.

A simple [example](https://github.com/ollyc2015/lush-codejam/tree/master/Lush%20Code%20Jam%202019/ExampleProject) project was created to guide the students, as many of the students had little or no experience with Creative Programming.

Please feel free to explore all the projects created by the students and congratulations to Teams 2 & 3, that were selected as winners by the Lush Tech R&D team:
