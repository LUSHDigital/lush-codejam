# Lush Code Jam 2019

## Project Background & Build Instructions

This tutorial assumes the user is using WAMP server.

Place the project inside the `www` folder of your WAMP server and make sure the server is running. 

Open up a web browser and type http://localhost/Team2/Bath%20Bomb%20Selector/

You will be presented with three different bath bombs which represent different scents - from left to right; Fresh, Honey, Sweet.

The idea is to render an image that represents the type of scent given off by each bath bomb.

Select a bath bomb and watch the image render render in using a creative approch. 

To go back to the bath bomb selection, simply refresh the page.
